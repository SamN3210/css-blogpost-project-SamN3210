            <p class="block_preview_text">There are over 800 Pokémon in existence at this very moment! Squirtle is my favorite Pokémon. It was my first starter and holds a very special place in my heart. While its design is simplistic compared to other Pokémon, it looks very cute! The compliments go on and on!</p>

            <p class="block_preview_text">I have played every mainstream Pokémon video game up until Sword and Shield. I don't have a Switch so my opinions will be limited. My favorite video game would have to be Pokémon Black. The region is spectacular; the gameplay is marvelous; the Pokémon designs and mechanics are a pleasure to play.</p>
